@article{Deng2012,
abstract = {The mechanism of spontaneous doping of boron atoms into graphene is proposed from ab-initio calculations. When boron and oxygen atoms are placed beside the graphene plane, boron can substitute spontaneously carbon atom in graphene without any energy barrier. More interestingly, the mechanism of spontaneous boron doping is reversible, i.e., the boron dopant also can be removed by the similar barrier-free process. Therefore, the mechanism of doping and contra-doping in this paper should be very useful to control boron doping of graphene.},

The insights that led to the construction of the Rutgers–Chalmers van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) are presented with the aim of giving a historical perspective, while also emphasizing more recent efforts which have sought to improve its accuracy. In addition to technical details, we discuss a range of recent applications that illustrate the necessity of including dispersion interactions in DFT. This review highlights the value of the vdW-DF method as a general-purpose method, not only for dispersion bound systems, but also in densely packed systems where these types of interactions are traditionally thought to be negligible.}

abstract = {A pathway to open the band gap of graphene by p–n codoping is presented according to the first principles study. Two models are used: Lithium adsorbed on Boron-doped graphene (BG) and Boron–Nitrogen (B/N) codoping into graphene. The stability of Lithium adsorbed on BG is firstly analyzed, showing that the hollow site is the most stable configuration, and there is no energy barrier from some metastable configurations to a stable one. After the p–n codoping, the electronic structures of graphene are modulated to open a band gap with width from 0.0 eV to 0.49 eV, depending on the codoping configurations. The intrinsic physical mechanism responsible for the gap opening is the combination of the Boron atom acting as hole doping and Nitrogen (Lithium) as electron doping.},

The advantages, disadvantages, and preferential doping features of current synthesis approaches are compared, aiming to provide clues for developing new and controllable synthetic routes. We emphasize the distinct properties resulting from various dopants, different doping levels and configurations, and synergistic effects from co-dopants, hoping to assist a better understanding of doped graphene materials. The mechanisms underlying their advantageous uses for energy storage, energy conversion, sensing, and gas storage are highlighted, aiming to stimulate more competent applications.},

From results of energy-band structure, B-doped and N-doped bilayer graphenes exhibit p-type and n-type electronic properties, respectively, with carriers on both two layers. It is also found that the boron and the nitrogen defects are observable in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images, while AA- and AB-stacking patterns of doped bilayer graphene exhibit similar STM images.},

abstract = {Herein, the effects of substitutional doping of graphene with Ga, Ge, As, and Se are shown. Ge exhibits the lowest formation energy, whereas Ga has the largest one. Ga- and As-doped graphene display a reactivity that is larger than that corresponding to a double vacancy. They can decompose H2 and O2 easily. Variation of the type and concentration of dopant makes the adjustment of the interlayer interaction possible. In general, doping of monolayer graphene opens a band gap. At some concentrations, Ga doping induces a half metallic behavior. As is the element that offers the widest range of gap tuning. Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof calculations indicate that it can be varied from 1.3 to 0.3 eV. For bilayer graphene, the doped sheet induces charge redistribution in the perfect underneath sheet, which opens a gap in the range of 0.05-0.4 eV. This value is useful for developing graphene-based electronics, as the carrier mobility of the undoped sheet is not expected to alter.},

abstract = "With an emphasis upon a realistic description of the underlying electronic structure, we discuss the “Disordered Local Moment” (DLM) picture of metallic magnetism. Its formulation, based upon “first principles” foundations of the Spin Density Functional Approach is briefly derived. Within the context of this theory, we place our previous, self-consistent calculations of local moments in the paramagnetic state for several transition metals and describe some details of the electronic structure which may ultimately be compared with modern experimental measurements. Finally the theory and physical picture for the wave-vector dependent, static spin susceptibility, χ (q, T) above the Curie temperature, Tc, is outlined and the degree of short range magnetic order driven by the \{DLM\} electronic structure estimated. We illustrated the theory by explicit calculations for iron and preliminary calculations for nickel. Curie-Weiss behaviour is found for χ(0;T) of both metals and Curie temperatures are 1260 K for iron and 225 K for nickel. While the calculations for χ(q; T) are broadly consistent with the initially imposed \{DLM\} state, their interpretation for nickel is rather different from that of iron. A comparison with quasi-elastic neutron scattering measurements is briefly made. "

Incorporating the role of thermal vibrations in electrostatic energy calculations leads to the physical meaning of the Ewald sum method. The Ewald summation method determines the electrostatic potential and energy of point charges in a crystal at a temperature that is obtained from the width of the Gaussian and not at 0 K. For values of the width of the Gaussian commonly recommended for computational convenience temperatures exceed 10000 K.},

@article{Grimme2006,
abstract = {A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C(6) x R(-6). A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol(-1). The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C(6) x R(-6) terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.},

We here present a van der Waals density functional study of the desorption barrier energy of the ten smallest n-alkanes (of carbon chain length N = 1–10) from graphene. We find linear scaling with N , including a non-zero intercept with the energy axis, i.e. an offset at the extrapolation to N = 0. This calculated offset is quantitatively similar to the results of the TPD measurements. From further calculations of the polyethylene polymer we offer a suggestion for the origin of the offset.}

For the adsorption of a single molecule, we determine the optimal binding configuration and adsorption energy by translating and rotating the molecule. The adsorption energy for a single molecule of adenine is found to be 711 meV, which is close to the calculated adsorption energy of the similarly sized naphthalene.

@article{Smith_Karim_2015,
abstract = {We demonstrate humidity sensing using a change of electrical resistance of single- layer chemical vapor deposited (CVD) graphene that is placed on top of a SiO2 layer on a Si wafer. To investigate the selectivity of the sensor towards the most common constituents in air, its signal response was characterized individually for water vapor (H2O), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and argon (Ar). In order to assess the humidity sensing effect for a range from 1{\%} relative humidity (RH) to 96{\%} RH, devices were characterized both in a vacuum chamber and in a humidity chamber at atmospheric pressure. The measured response and recovery times of the graphene humidity sensors are on the order of several hundred milliseconds. Density functional theory simulations are employed to further investigate the sensitivity of the graphene devices towards water vapor. It is found that the interaction between the electrostatic dipole moment of the water and the impurity bands in the SiO2 substrate results in electrostatic doping of the graphene layer. The proposed graphene sensor provides rapid response and direct electrical read out and is compatible with back end of the line (BEOL) integration on top of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits.},

	abstract = {Although exfoliated graphene can be extremely strong, it is produced on too small a scale for materials application. Graphene can be produced on a more practical scale by chemical vapor deposition, but the presence of grain boundaries between crystallites apparently weakens the material. Lee et al. (p. 1073) show that postprocessing steps during the removal of the graphene sheets can oxidize the grain boundaries and weaken them. If these steps are avoided, the material is comparable in strength to exfoliated graphene. Pristine graphene is the strongest material ever measured. However, large-area graphene films produced by means of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are polycrystalline and thus contain grain boundaries that can potentially weaken the material. We combined structural characterization by means of transmission electron microscopy with nanoindentation in order to study the mechanical properties of CVD-graphene films with different grain sizes. We show that the elastic stiffness of CVD-graphene is identical to that of pristine graphene if postprocessing steps avoid damage or rippling. Its strength is only slightly reduced despite the existence of grain boundaries. Indentation tests directly on grain boundaries confirm that they are almost as strong as pristine. Graphene films consisting entirely of well-stitched grain boundaries can retain ultrahigh strength, which is critical for a large variety of applications, such as flexible electronics and strengthening components.},

By analyzing the resulting degradation at different stress times and oxide fields we show that there is a significant asymmetry between PBTI and NBTI with respect to their dependences on these parameters. Finally, we compare the results obtained on the high- k top gate and SiO 2 back gate of the same device and show that SiO 2 gate is more stable with respect to BTI.}
