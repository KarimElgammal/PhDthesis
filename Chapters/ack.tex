\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Anna Delin, my advisor for letting me be part of her research group at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I would love to thank her for the continuous support of my Ph.D. study and related research, for her patience, motivation, and immense knowledge. Her guidance helped me a lot in all the time of research leading to fulfilling this thesis as well. I could not have imagined having a better advisor and mentor for my Ph.D. studies. She is always keen on delivering the best help through weekly meetings despite her limited time. I learned and still learning much from her.
I do appreciate the continuous help, and fruitful inputs form my current of old group members (in alphabetical order): both Amina Mirsakiyeva and Fan Pan (for the much fun we had!), Johan Hellsvik, Lars Bergqvist, Mikael RÃ¥sander, Michele Visciarelli (much appreciated his help regarding this thesis), Pavel Bessarab, Reza Mahani, Simone Borlenghi. Moreover, I thank my friend and collaborator Anderson Smith for the patience and making me part of the community; Andy has always been keen on involving me in new ideas, projects and research direction discussions. Additionally, I appreciate the big help from Max Lemme for his constructive comments on our joint research projects. I appreciate the nice work with Xuge Fan and Arne Quellmalz and wish to continue our excellent ongoing projects. I would like to extend my gratitude for input from old friends who are always keen on helping me; Loay for his impressive checks on DFT chapter and Shady for his meaningful comments throughout the text. I also appreciate the help and support from close friends Mina for his thoughtful help and Lamis for her endless support. I would also like to include all other Ray2een! members (Bada, Walid, Ma7ma7, Bakr, Hatem) for their continuous encouragement as well as Ramy being always here. 
I do want to extend to the SeRC and the SNIC at the PDC, KTH as well as NSC and Abisko supercomputers.
